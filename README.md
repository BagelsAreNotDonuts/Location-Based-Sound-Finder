# Overview

The second part of the cross-platform-project for COMP2140.

Inspired by 'Pokemon Go', it plots the locations of sound samples on the map, the locations and sound being taken from the database associated with the web app.

Based on the user's tracked location and proximity to these locations, the samples will be shared to them on the app, allowing them to listen their playbacks.

There is also a profile screen which allows one set a profile picture and name. (Saves them to a usestate, not saved to any database)
